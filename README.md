# Description
We implemented Prim's MST Algorithm by creating MinHeap, Graph and Edge classes in Java. 
Our main class is the 'Main.java' class, and to run our program, you just need to run the main
class. It should print out the graph with the corresponding weights and edges. Then it will print the 
Prim's MST in order, starting at Vertex 1. It will show which vertices are visited, and the weight of each edge. It will then
print the total weight at the bottom. We did not need to use all the pre-defined methods that Prof. Ouda 
defined in the assignment, so we did not make implementations for all of those methods. We only implemented methods 
we were going to use. Our input file is in the resources folder, and the file path should be 
correct, so you shouldn't have to change that.
